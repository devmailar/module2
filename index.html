    <h1>Character</h1>
    <h2>by Albert Einstein, interpretation by Michael R. Burch</h2>
    <main>
        <p>
            Great spirits have often encountered violent opposition from weak minds<br>
            because anger dwells only in the bosom of fools<br>
            and weakness of attitude soon becomes weakness of character.
        </p>
        <p>
            Only two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity (and I'm not sure about the former) ;<br>
            furthermore, we can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.
        </p>
        <p>
            The world is a dangerous place: not just because of the people who are evil,<br>
            but also because of the good people who don't do anything about it.
        </p>

            He who joyfully marches to music rank and file has already earned my contempt:<br>
            he has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him the spinal cord would surely suffice.
