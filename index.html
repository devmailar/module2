    <h1>Character</h1>
    <h2>by Albert Einstein, interpretation by Michael R. Burch</h2>
    <p>
        Great spirits have often encountered violent opposition from weak minds<br>
        because anger dwells only in the bosom of fools<br>
        and weakness of attitude soon becomes weakness of character.
    </p>
    <p>
        Only two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity (and I'm not sure about the former) ;<br>
        furthermore, we can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.
    </p>
    <p>
        The world is a dangerous place: not just because of the people who are evil,<br>
        but also because of the good people who don't do anything about it.
    </p>
    <p>
        He who joyfully marches to music rank and file has already earned my contempt:<br>
        he has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him the spinal cord would surely suffice.
